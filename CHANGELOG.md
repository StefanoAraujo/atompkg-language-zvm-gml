## 0.1.1 - Bug fix
* Toggle command throws an exception due to a publishing typo

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Highlighting for IBM Script and GML/BookMaster tags and comments.  Rather than highly specific highlighting, only the general abstract tag syntax is recognized in most cases... comments, tags, labels.
* Flag nested :annot. as illegal, per the BookMaster manual
* File type must be SCRIPT in order for Atom to apply the grammar automatically.
